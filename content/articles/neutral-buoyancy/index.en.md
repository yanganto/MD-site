Neutral buoyancy is a phenomenon familiar to every certified diver. It occurs when the weight and buoyancy of an object are precisely equal, and the average density of the object is precisely equal to the density of the fluid, allowing the object to float freely in the fluid.

Since the volume of the lungs changes during breathing, a diver's buoyancy also changes. Therefore, achieving neutral buoyancy through breathing is the first hurdle for beginner divers. As exhaled air is lost during a dive, the air tank becomes lighter, and an aluminum tank gradually shifts from sinking to floating. Due to the varying weight of individual regulators, neutral buoyancy occurs at different tank pressures, typically around 70 bar.

The Insta 360 camera's bulky housing adds significant buoyancy, but this can be adjusted using a metal dive hook to achieve neutral buoyancy. This video demonstrates how to achieve neutral buoyancy for the oxygen, camera, and diver. After having a better understanding of your own and your equipment's buoyancy, you will be able to better deal with various emergencies underwater.
