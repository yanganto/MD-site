In the northern part of Taiwan's main island, the diving season is from Qingming festival(April) to
Mid-Autumn festival(October). Not only the cold water, but also northeast monsoon affect the
visibility of the diving sites in the east north part of the main island. As you can see there are
swells on the north coast these days, so Taiwanese divers in the north are taking this time to 
maintain gears, for example, I replaced the strap of my back mount.

**Highly customized on course and device for you is also our goal.**  So if you are interested in 
diving in Taiwan in this season, we are happy to lead you to the southern diving sites, Kenting and
Xiaoliuqiu Island, where they are still warm and good for almost all the year.  Besides, the living
style in southern Taiwan is chile, and it is still convenient with delicious food.
