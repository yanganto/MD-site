Today, I'd like to introduce a dive site where you can easily spot manta rays. It's located on Nusa Penida Island in the Southern Hemisphere, near Bali, Indonesia. On the south side of the island, there's a manta cleaning station, also known as Manta Point, where manta swim in to be cleaned by smaller fish. Because it's close to land and less than 10 meters deep, which is about the training depth for scuba divers. Besides, it is also a popular spot for snorkelers and freedivers. So it an easily accessible dive site. Manta rays have distinct spots and stripes on their abdomens, similar to human fingerprints, and the prominent male sex organ on their tails makes it easy to distinguish between males and females. If you have the opportunity to scuba dive to this spot, observe these features from below, take photos, and upload them to [manta matcher](https://mantamatcher.org) to learn more about manta rays!

It's recommended to play in 4K and full screen, panoramic videos can rotate camera in youtube.
