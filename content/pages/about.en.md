# Good morning, diver!
My name is Antonio, I live in Northern Taiwan and like outdoor activities. In my early years,
I went from climbing, creeks, rock climbing, and recently I liked diving. Therefore, in 2024, I 
completed the PADI diving master training at in Taiwan Dive in Kenting and officially entered the
professional stage. In 2025, I completed the SDI open water coach training at USPC in New Taipei 
City. In addition, I am also a freediver in Molchanovs Wave 1.

As we embark on the journey of diving education, in addition to compliance training, I hope to 
bring more complete and detailed skills to students, so that students can travel more safely and 
have more fun in diving in their future careers. In the past, I was instructor in a hiking club and
served as a lecturer of map reading and navigation. With more than ten years of experience in 
mountain climbing, I can share more details on navigation; I am also a rock climber. In addition to 
various rock climbing certifications, I also have a TRAA industrial rope first-level rope technician 
license, so the knots and hooks taught to students are correct and not careless; When I was a 
student, I served as the president of Jianzhong Sign Language Club for 8th, and I knew the subtle 
way of sign language and can communicate clearly with students underwater; My background is 
Chemistry in studing so I can teach decopression and gas equation professionally.  I am a 
maintenance technician of YHS regulators(NEX manufactor), therefore, I will definitely give 
reasonable and well-founded suggestions for diving gears.

With the above experience in the past, combined with the flexible teaching of the small class and 
the flexibility of the SDI system, I am confident to bring you deep and quality diving courses, and 
make solid diving abilities, so that you can learn diving into driving-like life skills.
Not only can you get a driver's license, but also can drive on your own to anywhere.
