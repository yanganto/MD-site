## Re-activate Program
### Program Objectives
This program is designed for divers who already hold a diving certification but have become rusty due to a busy lifestyle.

### Eligibility
Open to all divers with any diving certification.

### Program Content
The 2025-2026 program includes:
1. Prior to the dives, a brief classroom session to review essential safety theory.
2. Dive 1: A dive in relatively calm open water to review core diving skills.
3. Debrief and break on shore.
4. Dive 2: Depending on conditions, a dive in a suitable location to review skills related to movement and buoyancy control.
5. (For two participants) Debrief and break on shore.
6. (For two participants) Dive 3: Depending on conditions, a dive in a suitable location for comprehensive skill review.

Safety is our top priority; each session will have only one or two participants.  For a single participant, the program will consist of steps 1-4. For two participants, steps 1-4 will be followed by an additional dive (steps 5 and 6) at no extra cost.

## Fees
The program fee is 166 USD per person.  The location can be flexible, including various coastal areas in Taiwan. Additional travel and accommodation expenses for more remote locations are not included in the fee, but we will assist with arrangements.
