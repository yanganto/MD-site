## Intensive Diving Skills Program
### Program Objectives
This program is designed for divers who already hold a diving certification and want to improve their skills or adjust their equipment. It's particularly suitable for divers planning international diving trips, allowing them to optimize their diving skills and equipment before their trip, ensuring a more enjoyable experience.


### Eligibility
Open to all divers with any diving certification.

### Program Content
The 2025-2026 program includes:

1. Prior to the program, we will have a one-on-one consultation to review your equipment and prepare any necessary parts.
2. Dive 1: Dive with your current equipment to identify any issues.
3. Adjust equipment based on Dive 1.
4. Dive 2: Dive with the adjusted equipment to develop proper technique.
5. (For two participants) Adjust equipment based on Dive 2.
6. (For two participants) Dive 3: Dive with the adjusted equipment to reinforce proper technique.

Safety is our priority; each session will have only one or two participants. For one participant, the program will consist of steps 1-4. For two participants, steps 1-4 will be followed by an additional dive (steps 5 & 6), at no extra cost, ensuring both participants' equipment is optimized.  Steps 2-6 will be completed on the same day.

Adjustments include: BC length, strap length, component replacement, accessory and weight placement.  Compatible equipment includes jacket-style, wing-style, and side-mount systems. These can be discussed during the initial consultation.

### Fees
The program fee is 166 USD per person. The location can be flexible, including various dive sites around Taiwan. Any additional expenses incurred due to repairs or replacement parts, or due to travel, accommodation, etc. for participants from remote locations, are not included in the activity fee, but we will assist with arrangements.
