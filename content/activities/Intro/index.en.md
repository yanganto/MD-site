## Beginner Experience Activity
### Activity Overview
This activity is designed for those with no prior diving experience.  Besides two introductory dives, we prioritize safety, and a brief theory lesson will be included before the dives.

### Activity Content
The 2025-2026 program includes:

1. A brief theory lesson (equipment overview, physiology, hand signals, problem-solving)
2. Two open water dives; all necessary diving equipment will be provided
  * The first dive will focus on acclimating you to breathing underwater and observing marine life
  * The second dive will help you become comfortable with using fins, allowing you to move underwater and on the surface with the instructor's assistance, exploring the underwater world

Safety is our top priority; each session will have only one participant, and one certified diver friend may accompany you.

## Fees
The activity fee is 166 USD (34 USD for a friend to accompany you). The location can be flexible, including various coastal areas in Taiwan. However, additional travel and accommodation costs for more remote locations are not included in the fee, but we will assist with arrangements.
