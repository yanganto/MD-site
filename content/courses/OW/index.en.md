## Scuba Diving Customized Lessons (OW Course)

### Course Objectives
Morning Diver's customized scuba diving lessons utilize the internationally recognized Scuba Diving International (SDI) system, which emphasizes both flexibility and standards.  Designed for those who want to learn to dive, our small group (1-2 students) and personalized instruction helps students master essential diving skills. Our philosophy is to make scuba diving a life skill, like driving a car. Once learned, you can easily rent equipment and participate in diving activities in any country you travel to.

### Course Content
The 2025-2026 course includes:

1. Complete theoretical course (classroom instruction)
2. Calm water training (number of sessions may vary)
3. Four open water dives (ocean)
All necessary scuba diving equipment is provided.

We focus on quality and pace of learning. We move to the next stage only after ensuring students understand and master each skill, making the learning process as natural and stress-free as possible.

### Fees
The course fee is 660 USD.  Class location is flexible, including pools or open water locations in different regions of Taiwan. Additional travel and accommodation expenses for more remote locations are not included in the course fee, but we will assist with arrangements.
