## Scuba Diving Customized Lessons (OW Course)

### Course Objectives
Morning Diver's customized scuba diving lessons utilize the internationally recognized Scuba Diving International (SDI) system, which emphasizes both flexibility and standards.  Designed for those who want to learn to dive, our small group (1-2 students) and personalized instruction helps students master essential diving skills. Our philosophy is to make scuba diving a life skill, like driving a car. Once learned, you can easily rent equipment and participate in diving activities in any country you travel to.

### Course Content
The 2025-2026 course includes:

1. Complete theoretical course (classroom instruction)
2. Calm water training (number of sessions may vary)
3. Four open water dives (ocean)
All necessary scuba diving equipment is provided.

We focus on quality and pace of learning. We move to the next stage only after ensuring students understand and master each skill, making the learning process as natural and stress-free as possible.

### Course Flexibility
The course is primarily held in northern Taiwan.  However, due to the limited infrastructure and accessibility of public transportation and facilities along the northeastern coast, we will assist students with logistics. We provide transportation within a one-hour drive from the training location, and our vehicles are equipped with freshwater and shower facilities for students to rinse off immediately after their dives. The four open water dives can be split into two separate days, minimizing fatigue and maximizing learning.  This allows for flexibility in location and timing. Students can combine the course with a trip to Jiufen or Keelung, then travel to the northeastern coast for a full-day two open water dives, returning to Banqiao High-Speed Rail Station afterward. We encourage students to explore the northern coast and northeastern region, enriching their understanding of Taiwan while completing the course. This also benefits the local economy without incurring extra costs.

Our instructors also have experience teaching in Kenting and other areas outside Taipei. Students are generally responsible for their own accommodation and transportation costs.  For locations north of Taichung, there is an additional fee of 66 USD; for Kenting, 133 USD, with safety being our non-negotiable priority.

### Fees
The course fee is 660 USD.  Class location is flexible, including pools or open water locations in different regions of Taiwan. Additional travel and accommodation expenses for more remote locations are not included in the course fee, but we will assist with arrangements.
